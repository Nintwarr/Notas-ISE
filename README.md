# Notas-ISE
These are my notes from the practice hours of Ingenier√≠a de Servidores

Please note these are **sketchy** notes to guide me through the process of installing every virtual machine and executing almost every command we needed.

The notes will be parsed into markdown as I have time to.

## Directory structure
- The main folders refer to the *Practice Number*.
- Inside those folders you'll find *.txt* or *.md* files including notes from individual classes each.
